Integration with external software
==================================

Models developed using Koogu may be employed outside of
the Koogu framework, by integrating with other standalone
software tools. Currently, models that you train using Koogu
can be easily incorporated in Raven Pro.

Raven Pro
---------
Raven Pro, starting with v1.6.5, includes support
for `using Koogu-trained models natively within its user
interface <https://ravensoundsoftware.com/knowledge-base/learning-detector/>`_
â€” simply load a trained model and apply to audio files
you are currently analyzing, and detections will be shown
immediately in the waveform/spectrogram panes.

Before you can use your models in Raven Pro, you will need to
generate metadata to describe your model's inputs and outputs.
